# **📌 1. Computer Basics & Essential Windows Settings**  

Before writing code, beginners **must** understand basic computer operations and configure Windows properly.  

### **✅ Understanding the Basics of a Computer**  
🔹 What is an **Operating System (OS)?**  
   - An OS is software that manages the hardware and software of a computer.  
   - Examples: **Windows (most common), macOS (Apple), Linux (advanced users).**  
   - Since you are using Windows, focus on learning **Windows settings, commands, and shortcuts.**  

🔹 Understanding **Files, Folders, and File Extensions**  
   - Everything on a computer is stored as **files** inside **folders**.  
   - File extensions tell you what type of file it is:  
     - `.exe` → Executable program  
     - `.txt` → Text file  
     - `.zip` → Compressed file  
     - `.png, .jpg` → Image files  
     - `.html, .css, .js` → Web development files  

### **✅ Important Windows Settings to Configure**  

#### **1️⃣ Show File Extensions (Important for coding!)**  
By default, Windows **hides file extensions**. This makes it hard to know what type of file you’re working with.  

**How to enable file extensions:**  
➡️ Open **File Explorer** → Click **View** → Check **File name extensions**  

#### **2️⃣ Enable Developer Mode (For coding & debugging tools)**  
➡️ **Go to Settings** → Click **Privacy & Security** → Select **For Developers** → Turn ON **Developer Mode**  

#### **3️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables (For running programming tools)**  
Certain programs like **Node.js, Python, Java** require **environment variables** to work correctly.  

**How to set them up:**  
➡️ Open **Control Panel** → **System** → **Advanced System Settings** → Click **Environment Variables**  
➡️ Add paths for **Node.js, Python, Java** (if installed)

# **📌 2. Essential Software & Tools for Developers**  

To code efficiently, beginners **must** install the right tools.  

### **✅ Text Editors & IDEs (For Writing Code)**  
🔹 **VS Code** (Best for beginners)  
   - Lightweight, powerful, and customizable  
   - Download: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  

🔹 **Sublime Text** (Lightweight alternative)  
   - Download: [https://www.sublimetext.com/](https://www.sublimetext.com/)  

---

### **✅ Version Control (Git & GitHub)**  
🔹 **Git** → A tool that tracks changes in code.  
🔹 **GitHub** → A website where you can store and share your code online.  

🔹 **Install Git for Windows**: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)  
🔹 **Basic Git Commands:**  
   - `git init` → Initialize a new repository  
   - `git add .` → Stage all changes  
   - `git commit -m "message"` → Save changes  
   - `git push` → Upload code to GitHub  

---

### **✅ Package Managers (For Installing Software Easily)**  
Package managers **help install tools without downloading manually**.  

🔹 **Chocolatey** (For Windows software)  
   - Install Chocolatey: Open **PowerShell as Admin** and run:  
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
     ```
   - Install software easily:  
     ```powershell
     choco install vscode git nodejs python
     ```  

🔹 **npm** (For JavaScript libraries) → Installed with Node.js  
🔹 **pip** (For Python libraries) → Installed with Python  

---

### **✅ Database Tools (For Storing & Managing Data)**  
🔹 **MongoDB Compass** (For MongoDB databases)  
🔹 **MySQL Workbench** (For MySQL databases)  

---

### **✅ Terminal & Command Line Alternatives**  
🔹 **Git Bash** → Better than CMD for Git commands  
🔹 **Windows Terminal** → Modern alternative to CMD

# **📌 3. Programming Fundamentals (Start Here!)**  

A **programming language** allows you to **write instructions** for a computer. Beginners should start with **one language** before learning others.  

### **✅ Choose a Programming Language**  
🔹 **Python** → Easiest for beginners  
🔹 **JavaScript** → Essential for web development  
🔹 **C** → Good for understanding core programming concepts

### **✅ Programming Basics (Common to All Languages)**  
1️⃣ **Variables & Data Types** → Store data  
2️⃣ **Operators** → Perform actions (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
3️⃣ **Conditional Statements** → Decision-making (`if`, `else`, `switch`)  
4️⃣ **Loops** → Repeating actions (`for`, `while`)  
5️⃣ **Functions** → Reusable blocks of code  
6️⃣ **Arrays & Objects** → Storing multiple values
